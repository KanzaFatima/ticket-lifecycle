<p>
Jane will open the first ticket which says entire mobile banking is down. We are supposing that here jane will work as both the helpdesk technician and the que manager. Start the process by setting the SLA. Because this is  the business impacting problem so set the SLA to SEV-A.

<p>
Change the department of the ticket from support to System Administrator, because system administrator has the all permissions to do everything.
  
Change the priority level from normal to emergency.

<p>
These are the threats and we can see as jane is making changes and adding comments, we can see them. So the system administrator is responsible for the mobile banking and jane will coordinate with them to bring the mobile banking back online.
