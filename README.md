Jane will open the first ticket which says entire mobile banking is down. We are supposing that here jane will work as both the helpdesk technician and the que manager. Start the process by setting the SLA. Since this problem involves a business, set the SLA to SEV-A.

These are the threads and as jane is making changes and adding comments, we can see them. The system administrator in this scenario is responsible for mobile banking. Jane will coordinate with them to bring the mobile banking back online.
